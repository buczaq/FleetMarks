![FleetMarks - there is something between tab and bookmark...](banner.png)

# What is FleetMark?

Do you often come across content that is too interesting to close it, but you don't have time to read it at the moment?

Of course you do. And you probably do one of these two things.

1. You leave the tab open... And another one. And then another one... This can quickly get messy!
2. You save it to bookmarks, but it introduces a disorder among the important stuff you keep there - besides, bookmarks are not so lightweight to manage. At least not by one click.

Well, FleetMarks try to be something in-between.

This browser plugin introduces **lightweight bookmarks**. They are accessible with one click in one place. You can easily add a page to FleetMarks and close its tab within one operation. And when you open the bookmark, it disappears from the list.

Isn't it wonderful?! Well, I guess it's not - let's have some respect to the superlatives.

But it's still pretty cool, right?

### Further development

1. Make whole rows clickable, not just the link.
2. Add page icon to the entry.
